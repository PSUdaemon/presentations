Disclaimer
==========

* Documentation training consists of 15 years of doing it
    
    http://httpd.apache.org/docs

* There are whole conferences on this stuff

    http://conf.writethedocs.org/

* There are numerous books that says all of this better

But ...

You came to my talk, so I'll try not to waste your time.

Write A Better FM
=================

.. image:: images/kathysierra.jpg

.. note:: Kathy gets credit for saying this, but I've been saying it for
   years. If your documentation is terrible, people will find a
   different solution. If your documentation is ok, but your customer
   support is terrible, your community will fail. A great product with bad
   docs is less usable than a terrible product with great docs and a
   friendly community.

----

The Common Wisdom
=================

* Documentation in Open Source is terrible
* Nobody wants to do it
* This is simply a reality of Open Source, and we have to put up with it

----

The Truth
=========

* Lots of people want to write docs. Some of them can even write a coherent sentence.
* We make it way too hard for them to participate.
* So, they flock to third-party forums, and Stack Overflow, where they share misconceptions and worst-practice "solutions" with one another.

----

Better Docs
===========

If we want better docs, we need to lower the barrier to entry for new docs authors.

We also need for the experts to be easier to talk to, so that those potential contributors can get their questions answered.

----

Have you noticed ...
====================

The more likely a support channel is to tell you to RTFM, the worse the FM is likely to be?

Kindness and patience in the community directly correlate to a helpful
tone, and user focus in the documentation.

----

So, what do we do?
==================

There's a lot to be said for "Just Start Writing", but as a docs team
you need to step back and answer a few questions.

.. note:: Figure out who the audience is. Personas help. Actually talk to people. Realize that they are not all young white men.

----

ドキュメント
============

* Not all young white English-speaking men who grew up watching Monty Python.

----

----

Inside Jokes
============

* Form a sense of community

* Keep others out of that community

* Tread carefully

.. note:: This suggestion has resulted in VERY strong responses from
   people who feel that I'm robbing the personality from their writing.
   Be warned.

----

Colloquialisms
==============

* Make your documentation feel conversational and welcoming

* Alienate people who don't know what they mean

* Tread carefully

----

Where?
======

.. note:: Story: "social site" at $College, and discouraging people from
   using Facebook because it's not the "official" site.

* If you build it, they still won't come.
* Find out where the audience is. 
* Go there. IRC/Mailing lists/Forums/G+/Facebook/Twitter
* Talk to people. Drop helpful URLs.

----

What?
=====

* What are they asking?
* When your product is young, you answer the questions that you expect to be asked
* As it matures, you should listen to what's actually being asked

.. note:: Find out what they're actually asking. Realize that your "frequently asked questions" might not be the right ones. Answering the wrong questions isn't helpful.

----

Solutions
=========

.. image:: images/fixedit.jpg

If you don't provide solutions to real problems, people will come up
with their own solutions, which might not be quite the best idea.

----

Smart Questions
===============

.. image:: images/ericraymond.jpg

.. note:: Good answers are the asker's responsibility.

There is an ancient and hallowed tradition: if you get a 
reply that reads “RTFM”, the person who sent it thinks 
you should have Read The F***ing Manual. He or she is 
almost certainly right. Go read it.

RTFM has a younger relative. If you get a reply that reads 
“STFW”, the person who sent it thinks you should have 
Searched The F*ing Web. He or she is almost certainly 
right. Go search it. (The milder version of this is when 
you are told “Google is your friend!”)

Eric is Wrong
=============

It is not a "hallowed tradition".

It's bad manners, and it's juvenile.

It's time to grow up.

* Laziness

* Impatience

* Hubris

.. note: The three virtues of a programmer are the opposite of the three
   virtues of a human being: Dilligence, Patience, Humility. (Larry
   Wall.)

----

Laziness
========

* Answer the question thoroughly, once
* Save your answer
* Next time, give them a URL
* Better to do something well, once, than to do to it poorly, again and again

----

Patience
========

* Impatience with the question comes across as disrespect for the questioner
* Arrogance and disrespect are at the heart of the RTFM mindset
* If you cannot be patient, please let someone else answer the question, and find a different hobby

----

Love is patient, love is kind ... it does not keep a record of offenses.
    (I Corinthians 13 - The Bible)

----

Humility
========

* You don't know everything
* The documentation isn't perfect yet
* Remember that once you, too, were completely ignorant

.. note:: Try to remember that moment that you were a complete newbie,
   asking stupid questions. Cherish that moment. If you can't remember,
   then it's probably been too long since you learned something new.

----

The RTFM attitude is indicative of 
arrogance and impatience, whereas 
truly great documentation is the 
result of patience and humility.

(Yes, they should read the docs. No, you 
should not be rude.)

----

Stupid questions
================

* There is such a thing as a stupid question.
* Your attitude towards stupid questions says a lot about you.
* It's your job to guide them to the right question, and its answer.

.. image:: images/stupid.jpg

----

Scope
=====

.. image:: images/scope.jpg

* You must decide the scope of your documentation
* Document your scope
* Decide not to answer the wrong questions, but figure out where to send people for those answers
* Be polite about it

.. note:: That's what hyperlinks are for, after all.

----

How?
====

* How do we answer the question?

* Reference manuals

* HowTos

* FAQs

* Examples

* Make it easier for people to participate in creating those docs

* Quit being a jerk.
